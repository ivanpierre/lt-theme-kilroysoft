===================

KilroySoft's theme on LightTable

Theme for my own usage of LightTable.

- Marked external brackets.
- Raibow brackets.
- Constants in italic (strings, numbers, keyworks, true, false, nil, ...)
- More contrasted colors, I'm a bit daltonian... :D

The CSS file should be placed in .lighttable\css\themes\ directory.

Warning if you change the name of the file, you should change the names of the classes in the CSS, else LightTable will not recognize them...

Enjoy
